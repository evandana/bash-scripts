# Contribution Guidelines


## Clarity

- Use headings appropriately for deliniating hierarchy
- Describe the intent and use before the instructions

## Follow the Formatting Pattern

- Sentence case for headers
- Hashes (`#`) for hierarchy of headers
- Two line breaks around H2s and their content (as in this raw file)
- Dashes (`-`) or `1.`'s for lists, unordered and ordered, respectively
- Use [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) formatting
- Add new files for new topics in a flat structure and then reference them on the main README.md with a link
- Setup and Development can be separate topics. e.g GitHub setup at GE should be a separate file from GitHub maintenance.


## Should _This_ Snippet Go in This Repo?

- Yes, if it is a "general purpose" snippet
- No, if it is highly specific to a particular app or technology not generally used in GE Digital


## Pull Request or Directly Commit?

- Unless you're restructuring files, just make direct edits and commits, even using the GitHub UI
